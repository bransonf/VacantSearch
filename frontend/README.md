# Vacancy Map
> Search for vacant lots in the Saint Louis, MO area.

This is the frontend portion of the Vacancy project. The frontend is a basic React app. If you need help setting up the toolchain to develop a React app, read [the toolchain guide](./toolchain.md).

By default, the frontend will communicate with the hosted demo backend. You do not need to run your own local backend to run the frontend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development options
### Bypass server
You can bypass the server and use mock API response data by setting `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_API_DATA='yes'` in your `.env.local` file. **Do not add this variable to .env** - it will break the app. Create your own `.env.local` file in the same directory as `.env`. You will need to restart your development server for the new variable to take effect.

## CI
https://openstl.github.io/VacantSearch/ reflects the latest frontend code on `master`. The automatic Github Pages deployment is handled by a Github action. If you are a privileged user, you can run `npm run deploy` to manually deploy code to Github Pages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
